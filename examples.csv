No, of course you haven't, typos and all. You know if your concern was to include a mention that a very small part of the extremities of the area is found the other side of the Green Line, you could just have added that information, rather than repeatedly reverting out all mention of the West Bank or placing the ""in Israel"" part ahead of the West Bank as if to suggest that more than 50% was that side. That's called collaborative as opposed to disruptive editing. Anyhow, we seem to have some form of accuracy now, although I would dispute the addition of ""Judea"" (which was not in the original suggested compromise). As we know, the use of the term is a matter of some debate as to what it refers to (it's certainly never used to refer to an area wholly ""in Israel""), and whether it is really used at all these days as a NPOV term; and in this case the source as quoted doesn't seem to use it, and even if it did, it is only one book, seemingly about archaeology and ancient history. --Nickhh (talk) 12:20, 15 April 2009 (UTC)",0.4318181818181818

I have reverted Yopie's truncation of the edits made by Lars T.  I think the section still needs a lot of work but Yopie's edit truncated the section to the point where it omitted key facts about the expulsion.
We must have a section that discusses the expulsion because it is, if you will, the epilogue to the story of the occupation.  There are those who claim that, if the occupation hadn't happened, the expulsions wouldn't have happened either.
I left in most of the debate about statistics although I have mixed feelings about that.  Most of the details of the debate should be presented in the article Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia.  However, we need some statistics to communicate the scale of the ""human tragedy"".

166232,Polish occupation of Czechoslovakia,Extent of coverage of the postwar expulsions,Pseudo-Richard,2010-12-08 16:46:14,POST,"@Yopie - Firstly, I know what WP:OWN says.  It says that I don't own the article.  Guess what, neither do you.  Decisions at Wikipedia are made by consensus.  If you don't agree with me, get other editors involved in the discussion.  Consult WP:DR.  If we cannot reach agreement, the next step is a RFC.
I actually agree with you that this article is about the occupation and not about the expulsions.  However, the expulsions are relevant because they are fairly closely linked to the occupation.  Were it not for the German occupation, the expulsions would have been much harder to get support for both within Czechoslovakia and in the international community.  I'm not saying that there weren't nationalist and irredentist sentiments prior to Munich.  However, up until then, it was a problem that did not demand an immediate and drastic solution.
The Nazi occupation changed the minds of most of the resistance groups in the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile or, to the extent that their minds were already made up, it deepened their conviction.  The Benes decrees were promulgated by the Czechoslovakian government-in-exile which got the agreement of the Big Three at Potsdam for the expulsions.  The drive for a permanent solution to ""the German problem"" arose after the reprisals for the Heydrich assassination during the occupation.  The expulsions are the epilogue or denouement of the occupation story.  The question therefore is not about whether we discuss the expulsions but about how much to say about them and what exactly to say.
Secondly, I think you have a mistaken idea of what a POV fork is.  If I create a new article titled German liberation of Czechoslovakia that has a pro-Nazi view of the occupation, that would be a POV fork.  What we are debating is neither a content fork nor a POV fork and your misuse of those terms only serves to obscure the issues at hand.
Thirdly, I don't know how much of the text restored by Lars T. was written by him and how much was text written by someone else and simply restored by him.  However, IMO, it was highly POV and aimed at indicting the Czechoslovak government and people for the expulsions which were described in highly emotive POV language that was suggestive of a war crime.  I am not in favor of such language because it is emotive rather than factual and objective.  Of course, it's tragic that innocent people died during the expulsions.  However, this is not the article to get into an extended discussion of those issues.
I have tried to strike a more NPOV tone in what I wrote.  If I have failed to hit the ""NPOV sweet spot"", I am open to discussing how to make the language more NPOV.  However, blanket reversions of good-faith edits is often detrimental to the objective of writing an encyclopedic article.
Yopie, please take a step back, take a deep breath and repeat the words ""Richard is not Lars T.""  Then re-read what I wrote in the article and what I wrote above.  Then take another deep breath and repeat the words ""I don't own the article"".  Finally, consider what specifically you don't like about what I wrote in the article and explain your concerns here.
I think you'll find I'm open to reason and compromise if you'll only stop reverting my edits.
(@Lars T. - forgive me if I am attributing to you the highly POV text that you restored after Yopie deleted it.  I don't know if you wrote it or not.  I also don't have the patience to go figure it out.  Just ignore my criticisms if they don't apply to you.)

Plus the pre-1844 Church treated what we call Stake High Councils differently and there was some debate on how they related to each other and the traveling High Council. I am thinking this now:
# Start with a general Quorums and offices and relationship picture chart that is here - add adjustments according to sections other than 107.
# Have another picture that includes the administrative quorums and the full org as used in CJCoLDS, and I could do Community of Christ too I think - I picked up some info about them when I was in Independence summer 2001.

The church organization during the early church underwent a number of changes through the years. For example, in 1830, there were just Elders, Priests, and Teachers, with Smith being the First Elder. (And some have argued, controversially, that Elder was originally an Aaronic Priesthood office.) The chart should also reflect more prominently the office of Patriarch, which was a much more important and independent position when it was held by Hyrum Smith. Also, I have a problem with the hierarchical nature of the chart. The hierarchical relationships implied by the arrows are generally the contribution of Brigham Young, rather than Joseph Smith.

179112,Rubber tired metro,Rubber Tired Metros as burdensome and having only political (not technical) merit,DavidArthur,2006-02-01 16:27:39,THREAD_STARTER,"""At the same time, Charles de Gaulle sought to differentiate the French and their way of doing things, as well as create a morale booster. So the real impetus for implementing this burdensome system was political, not technical merit. ""
Can anyone prove this claim? - that the principal reason for use of the rubber-tire system in the Paris metro is ""political, not technical"". Also, that DeGaulle had substantial input into the decision. Doubtlessly, supporters of such rubber tire systems would point out the numerous technical advantages of rubber tire metros (faster acceleration and braking, noise reduction compared to the older metros of that era, etc.).
Also, there is a potential issue of French-bashing. Calling a stereotypically ""French"" technology a  ""burdensome system"" (when it does have many merits) and claiming that it has ""not been widely adopted, except by the few cities listed below"" (when that list of cities  is actually fairly substantial and not limited to France or French-speaking people) really seems grossly inaccurate. Please don't forget that are an unusually large number of other wikipedia articles have portrayed French (and Canadian) people and things in a negative light.
Don't believe me? Just two (of many) examples. Look at older versions of the Jacques Chirac article. Even local anti-Chirac sentiment and rather bizarre political caricatures (such as Super Menteur) by his local French liberal rivals (Chirac is by all means conservative in the American sense) seem to warrant extended treatment. Even the George W Bush article (our currently very controversial US president and a comparable figure) doesn't get quite the same ultra-detailed account of nearly every little controversy imaginable. And keep in mind that most English speakers know much more about President Bush (for example) than they know about most French people or things. Another example: Look at the Bombardier (a large Canadian conglomerate) article - a large portion is devoted to its alleged corporate misdeeds. Almost every major corporation has such controversial issues, but very few such corporations have gotten such a detailed treatment (in any mnetion at all , in some cases) on wikipedia (look at the Lockheed Martin or General Electric pages for comparable US conglomerates). Also, weak claims such as  ""Bombardier's reputation may have been tarnished"" by delays on one recent small streetcar order for Las Vegas are made in the article, while the fact that the company has successfully completed many, much larger equipment orders without technical problems for many other buyers (such as New York City) for at least 2 decades, is not mentioned in the article.
So, if noone can substantiate the claims in the article about rubber tired technology in a reasonable time frame, I will edit the section (at a later time) to be more factual.

However, given the timeframe of the conversion of lines 1 & 4, he may have pushed for this solution, but I somewhat doubt it.
From the documents I possess, the usual explainantions for the development of rubber tire system is that the 1900-1930s Sprague-Thomson cars from the Paris subway had a very hard time on the steepest grades of the network, especially on the difficult 11 line. The new Materiel Articulé cars, whose design started in 1936, but were produced only in 1951, were not satisfactory either. This opened the path to the successful experiments of 1951, which validated the feasibility of the system, and the better performance on steep grade, acceleration and braking compared to the 30's cars. The RATP did not look back on rail cars until 1966, when it appeared that converting the whole network would be too long, too expensive, and that it would need to replace all the older cars before the end of the conversion. Given the performance improvements provided by the 60's technology, the gap between rubber-tires and rail was much smaller. As a result, the MF67, designed at thas moment, is the most used model on the RATP network, even if it is less capable than its tired counterparts.

Actually there is serious error in the way the Armstrong case is presented.
Currently it reads ""In 2012 Lance Armstrong admitted his guilt to the US Anti Doping Agency in order to stop further investigation of his alleged doping, therefore his previous wins became null and void. [187]"".
This statement is false and is not support by reference 187. Armstrong has not admitted guilt and has not been stripped by the Tour.
