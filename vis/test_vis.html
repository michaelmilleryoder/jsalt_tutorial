The link to Annual Report - American School of Classical Studies at Athens on Acharya's website as part of author's expertise/credentials was there earlier, in archives and is referenced her own books. 1 cf. 2. It is clear Dorothy M. Murdock wants an exception from WP:FULLNAME, editors in RFC understood that, and equally likely the author will continue to email every admin/user on Wikipedia, nevertheless if an author cites a public record with their name in it as their expertise in their books and website and it is also cited in reliable sources, there's no reason to grant that exception. What's more of an issue is that the American School of Classical Studies at Athens shows the author was simply an "alumna" - i.e. a young person on an extended summer school at the time at the time and in not "A Member" as claimed in the author's books.
